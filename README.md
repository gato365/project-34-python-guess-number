# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game, a simple yet engaging Python application designed to provide a fun way for students to practice their logical thinking and problem-solving skills. In this game, players are prompted to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, receiving feedback to guide them towards the correct answer.

## How It Works

The game picks a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess what it is. After each guess, the game tells the user whether their guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, at which point they are congratulated.

## Educational Objectives

- **Problem-Solving**: Students practice critical thinking by evaluating and adjusting their guesses based on feedback.
- **Math Skills**: Enhances understanding of higher and lower numerical values.
- **Persistence**: Encourages students to keep trying until they find the solution, fostering a growth mindset.

## Instructions for Teachers

1. **Setup**: Simply download the script and run it in a Python-enabled environment.
2. **Gameplay**: Students can play individually or in groups to guess the number. 
3. **Discussion**: After gameplay, engage students in a discussion about their strategies and what they learned from the experience.

## How to Run the Game

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

To run the game:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where the script is located.
3. Run the script with the command `python guessing_game.py` (replace `guessing_game.py` with the actual script filename if different).
4. The game will start and prompt the user to guess a number.



Set up the calculator by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gato365/project-34-python-guess-number
```

## Classroom Usage
After navigating to the cloned directory, you can run the Python script with your students:
```bash
cd project-34-python-guess-number
python guess_number.py
```



## Customization

Teachers can modify the code to change the range of numbers or the type of feedback provided to make the game more or less challenging depending on the age and skill level of the students.
